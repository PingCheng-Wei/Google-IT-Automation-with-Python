    "This script consists of two functions: populate_dictionary(filename) and find_email(argv). The function populate_dictionary(filename) reads the user_emails.csv file and populates a dictionary with name/value pairs. The other function, find_emails(argv), searches the dictionary created in the previous function for the user name passed to the function as a parameter. It then returns the associated email address. This script accepts employee's first name and last name as command-line arguments and outputs their email address.\n",

    "The script accepts arguments through the command line. These arguments are stored in a list named sys.argv. The first element of this list, i.e. argv[0], is always the name of the file being executed. So the parameters, i.e., first name and last name, are then stored in argv[1] and argv[2] respectively.\n",

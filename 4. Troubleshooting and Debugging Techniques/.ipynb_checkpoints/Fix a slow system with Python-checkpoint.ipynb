    "\n",
    "CPU bound means the program is bottlenecked by the CPU (Central Processing Unit). When your program is waiting for I/O (e.g., disk read/write, network read/write), the CPU is free to do other tasks, even if your program is stopped. The speed of your program will mostly depend on how fast that I/O can happen; if you want to speed it up, you'll need to speed up the I/O. If your program is running lots of program instructions and not waiting for I/O, then it's CPU bound. Speeding up the CPU will make the program run faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, the key to speeding up the program might not be to speed up the hardware but to optimize the program to reduce the amount of I/O or CPU it needs. Or you can have it do I/O while it also does CPU-intensive work. CPU bound implies that upgrading the CPU or optimizing code will improve the overall computing performance."

    "rsync(remote sync) is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between a computer and an external hard drive and across networked computers by comparing the modification time and size of files. One of the important features of rsync is that it works on the delta transfer algorithm, which means it'll only sync or copy the changes from the source to the destination instead of copying the whole file. This ultimately reduces the amount of data sent over the network.\n",

    "Now, when you go through the hierarchy of the subfolders of /data/prod, data is from different projects (e.g., , beta, gamma, kappa) and they're independent of each other. So, in order to efficiently back up parallelly, use multiprocessing to take advantage of the idle CPU cores. Initially, because of CPU bound, the backup process takes more than 20 hours to finish, which isn't efficient for a daily backup. Now, by using multiprocessing, you can back up your data from the source to the destination parallelly by utilizing the multiple cores of the CPU.\n",

Create a pool object of the Pool class of a specific number of CPUs your system has by passing a number of tasks you have. Start each task within the pool object by calling the map instance method, and pass the run function and the list of tasks as an argument."
